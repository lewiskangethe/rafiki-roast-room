Rafiki Roast Room – Roast. Relax. Repeat.

Rafiki Roast Room gets its name from the Swahili word “rafiki,” meaning friend. The idea behind the app is simple: create a friendly, welcoming space where great food is shared and enjoyed. This program brings that feeling to your terminal by letting you explore the menu, customize your selections, and place an order with ease.

The app is designed to make the ordering process smooth and enjoyable. You can pick your main dishes, choose your sides, add drinks, and see everything laid out clearly as you build your order. When you’re done, the system automatically creates a clean, detailed receipt so you can review exactly what you ordered.
